OZ80MANDIAS
===========

OZ80MANDIAS (simply pronounced Ozymandias) is a Z80 assembler for Sega Master System games.
It is named after the famous poem, in which a broken statue in the desert is the last remnant of a once mighty empire, now reduced to dust. The bitter-sweet message on the
plaque reads "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!". Since VB6 is now a dead language -- once a massive success of the Microsoft empire -- the name seemed fitting.
